# Cyclonebot
A python bot for Discord

## Notes
Uses the [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library, albeit from about August 2016, so probably many breaking changes behind the current version. I doubt it would work as a Discord bot right now.

There is an application token in the file; it has been revoked. If for some reason you actually want to use this, replace with your own token.

## Usage

Just run from the command-line. It runs in the background and logs messages. The pyw file is a feature of python scripts where they can be executed "headlessly", that is, without leaving a terminal window open.
